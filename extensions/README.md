# Extensions

This directory is where extensions to the "OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core"
specification should live.

These are extensions that are within the charter of the SWG and are being actively worked on. **Proposed** extensions should be created in the [proposals](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/tree/master/proposals) directory.
