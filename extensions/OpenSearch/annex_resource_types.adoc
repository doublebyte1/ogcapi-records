=== Overview

This annex describes commonly used codelists and identifiers for OGC resource types when qualifying resources via the record
schema's `properties.type` property.  Please note that these codelists and identifiers are NOT normative.  For information
communities wishing to further identify, it is suggested that a specification extension be developed to meet those
requirements.
