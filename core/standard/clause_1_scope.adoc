== Scope

This document specifies the behaviour of an API that supports the ability to
search collections of descriptive information, called records.  A record
contains summary information about a resource that a provider wishes to 
make discoverable.  Examples of resources include: a data collection, a service,
a process, a style, a code list, an Earth observation asset, a machine
learning model, a code list and so on.  Records represent resource
characteristics that can be searched and presented for evaluation and further
processing by both humans and software.  A record can also contain associations.
An association is a reference to another record or resource that is related to
the resource being described by the context record.
