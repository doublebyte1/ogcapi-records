== Requirements Class "Collections"

[[collections-overview]]
=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_collections.adoc[]

The purpose of the conformance class is to specify requirements that extend
the behaviour at the `/collections` endpoint to make it queryable by
OGC API - Records clients.

The conformance class defines the following extensions:

1. It extends the set of query parameters defined in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/collections/clause_8_collections.adoc#11-collections-metadata[Collections Metadata] section to support the richer set of query parameters defined in the <<parameters-section,Parameters>> clause of this specification.

2. It extends the schema of the collection information object defined in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/collections/clause_8_collections.adoc#12-collection-information[Collection Information] clause of the https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/core/OAPI_Common-Core.adoc[OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data] extension to add additional keys/properties that are required by OGC API - Records.


=== Collections Metadata

The https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/collections/clause_8_collections.adoc#11-collections-metadata[Collections Metadata] clause of the https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/core/OAPI_Common-Core.adoc[OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data] extension defines the `bbox`, `datetime` and 'limit' query parameters for the `/collections` resource. 

include::requirements/collections/REQ_collections_query-params.adoc[]

The collections metadata (i.e. HTTP GET on the `/collections` path) is defined in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/collections/clause_8_collections.adoc#response[Collections Metadata] clause of the https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/core/OAPI_Common-Core.adoc[OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data] extension.

=== Collection information

The collection information object is defined in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/collections/clause_8_collections.adoc#12-collection-information[Collection Information] clause of the https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/core/OAPI_Common-Core.adoc[OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data] extension.

The following table cross-walks the properties of the collection information
object with the core queryables.

The following requirements specify additional properties that a compliant
implementation of this conformance class must add to the collection 
information object.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_collections_title.adoc[]

include::requirements/collections/REQ_collections_description.adoc[]

No additional requirements are necessary for the `extent` property.

No additional requirements are necessary to the `links` property.  Since the
`links` property is mandatory for the collection information object, it will
always be present but because it is an optional core queryables, catalogue
clients will either know how to handle it or they will ignore it.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_collections_type.adoc[]

include::requirements/collections/REQ_collections_created.adoc[]

include::requirements/collections/REQ_collections_updated.adoc[]

NOTE: Adding, modifying, or deleting items from a collections are all examples of changes to that collection.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_collections_keywords.adoc[]

include::recommendations/collections/REC_collections_additional-properties.adoc[]

The collections metadata response is defined in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/collections/clause_8_collections.adoc#response[Collections Metadata] clause on the https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/core/OAPI_Common-Core.adoc[OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data] extension.

=== Examples

Example 1: List all the collections that lie within a specific bounding box and contains the the keyword `weather`.
