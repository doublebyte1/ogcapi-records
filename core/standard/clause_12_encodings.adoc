[[requirements-class-json-clause]]
== Requirements Class JSON

The following requirements apply to an OGC API - Records implementation when the following conditions apply:

. The API advertises conformance to the JSON Conformance Class
. The client negotiates a JSON or GeoJSON format

The JSON Requirements Class restricts requirements defined in the `Core` Requirements Class by imposing encoding-specific requirements. At this time, these additional requirements only apply to the HTTP response payloads. The sections below identify the scope of each new requirement and the `Core` requirements which lay within each scope.

include::requirements/requirements_class_json.adoc[]

=== Common

This section covers the requirements inherited from the API - Common standard. Its scope includes responses for the following operations:

* `{root}/`: Landing Page
* `{root}/api`: API Description
* `{root}/conformance`: Conformance Classes
* `{root}/collections`: Collections
* `{root}/collections/{collectionid}`: Collection Information

include::requirements/json/REQ_api-common.adoc[]

It is also necessary to advertise conformance with this Requirements Class.

include::requirements/json/REQ_json-conformance.adoc[]

=== Record 

GeoJSON is a commonly used format that is simple to understand and well supported by tools and software libraries. Since most Web developers are comfortable with using a JSON-based format supporting GeoJSON is recommended, if the feature data can be represented in GeoJSON for the intended use.



TBD: Requirements for the GeoJSON encoding of a record.





[[requirements-class-html-clause]]
== Requirements Class HTML

The following requirements apply to an OGC API - Records implementation when the following conditions apply:

. The API advertises conformance to the HTML Conformance Class
. The client negotiates an HTML format

The HTML Requirements Class restricts requirements defined in the `Core` Requirements Class by imposing encoding-specific requirements. At this time, these additional requirements only apply to the HTTP response payloads. The sections below identify the scope of each new requirement and the `Core` requirements which lay within each scope.

include::requirements/requirements_class_html.adoc[]

=== Common

This section covers the requirements inherited from the API - Common standard. Its scope includes responses for the following operations:

* `{root}/`: Landing Page
* `{root}/api`: API Description
* `{root}/conformance`: Conformance Classes
* `{root}/collections`: Collections
* `{root}/collections/{collectionid}`: Collection Information

include::requirements/html/REQ_api-common.adoc[]

It is also necessary to advertise conformance with this Requirements Class.

[[requirements-class-atom-clause]]
== Requirements Class ATOM

The following requirements apply to an OGC API - Records implementation when the following conditions apply:

. The API advertises conformance to the ATOM Conformance Class
. The client negotiates an ATOM format

The ATOM Requirements Class restricts requirements defined in the `Core` Requirements Class by imposing encoding-specific requirements. At this time, these additional requirements only apply to the HTTP response payloads. The sections below identify the scope of each new requirement and the `Core` requirements which lay within each scope.
