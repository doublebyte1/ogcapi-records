^|A |A record SHOULD include the top-level `time` member that indicates some characteristic temporal aspect of the resource that the record describes.
^|B |If such chracteristic temporal information about the resource is not available then the `time` member SHOULD, even though it is optional, still be included in the record and its values SHOULD be set to `null`.
