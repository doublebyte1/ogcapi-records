^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/core/record-links*
^|A |Implementations SHOULD use the record `links` property to provide hypermedia for navigation in the API (e.g. next record in a query response ) and alternate representations of the current record.
^|B |If a canonical URI is available for the record type that is the value of the core queryable _type_, a link with link relation type `type` to that canonical URI SHOULD be added to the `links` property. 
^|C |If a canonical URI is available for a license that is a value of the core queryable _license_, a link with link relation type `license` to that canonical URI SHOULD be added to the `links` property.
