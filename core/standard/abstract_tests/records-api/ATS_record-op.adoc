^|Requirement |<<req_records-api_record-op,/req/records-api/record-op>>
^|Test Method |. For a sufficiently large subset of all records in a record collection (path /collections/{collectionId}), issue an HTTP GET request to the URL /collections/{collectionId}/items/{recordId} where {collectionId} is the id property of the collection and {recordId} is the local identifier property of the record (the representation in the record content depends on the encoding).
