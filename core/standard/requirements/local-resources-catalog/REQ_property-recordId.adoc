^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/local-resources-catalog/recordId*

The `recordId` property SHALL be present in the information model of the local resources object.
|===

NOTE: Depending on the particular encoding of a record, the actual name of the `recordId` property may map to a differently named member.  For example, in the <<clause-record-encoding-json,GeoJSON encoding>> of a record, the `recordId` property maps to the `id` member.
