^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/record-core-query-parameters/ids-definition*
^|A |A Records API SHALL support the query by Ids (`ids`) parameter for the operation.
^|B |The characteristics of the `ids` parameter SHALL be as defined by requirement http://fix.em[`req/ids/fc-ids-definition`] of the http://fix.me[OGC API - Features - Part X: Title Unknown] standard.  The definition is copied here for convenience.  NOTE: fix reference/URL

[source,YAML]
----
name: ids
in: query
required: false
schema:
  type: array
  items:
    type: string
explode: false
----

^|C |An empty list of identifiers is a valid value for the `ids` parameter and indicates that the result set SHALL be empty.
|===

NOTE:  Is the behaviour in C correct?  If the `ids` parameter is empty should the server just ignore it?  ... which would imply that all records should be part of results set (subject to any other filters of course).
