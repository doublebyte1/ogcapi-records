^|A |Only records that have a spatial geometry that intersects the bounding box SHALL be part of the result set, if the `bbox` parameter is provided.
^|B |If a record has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.
^|C |The `bbox` parameter SHALL match all records in the collection that are not associated with a spatial geometry, too.
^|D |The coordinate values SHALL intersect the extent specified for the coordinate reference system.
