^|A |For each record collection, the extent property, if provided, SHALL provide bounding boxes that include all spatial geometries and time intervals that include all temporal geometries in this collection. The temporal extent may use null values to indicate an open time interval.
^|B |If a record has multiple properties with spatial or temporal information, it is the decision of the server whether only a single spatial or temporal geometry property is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.
