  variables:
    type: object
    description:
      This object contains one key per substitution variable in the 
      templated URL.  Each key defines the schema of one substitution
      variable using a JSON Schema fragment and can thus include things
      like the data type of the variable, enumerations, minimum values,
      maximum values, etc.  In combination with that templated URI, the
      variables section should provide enough information to bind to the
      target resource.  The complete set of variables is the union of the
      variables defined by this member and referenced via the "var-base"
      member.
  var-base:
    type: string
    description:
      The path to a dictionary that defines the characteristics of each
      substitution variable in the templated URI.  The complete set of
      variables is the union of the variables referenced by this member
      and any additional variables defined using the "variables" member.
