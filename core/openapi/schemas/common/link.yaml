      URI created by using valid values from the "variables" dictionary
      for the substitution variables.
    format: url
    example: http://data.example.com/buildings/123

  templated:
    type: string
    description:
      Supplies a parameterized version of the "href" URI where each variable
      portion of the URI is specified using a substition variable of the form
      "{variable_name}".
  variables:
    type: object
    description:
      This object contains one key per substitution variable in a "templated"
      URL.  Each key defines the schema of one substitution variable using
      a JSON Schema fragment and can thus include things like the data type
      of the variable, enumerations, minimum values, maximum values, etc.
      In combination with a "templated", the variables section should
      provide enough information to bind to the target resource.
      The complete set of variables is the union of the variables defined
      by this member and referenced via the "varBase" member.
  varBase:
    type: string
    description:
      The path to a dictionary that defines the characteristics of each
      substitution variable in the "templated" URI.  The complete set of
      variables is the union of the variables referenced by this member
      and any additional variables defined using the "variables" member.
