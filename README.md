> :warning: The OGC API - Records specification is **still a work in progress.**  Please be aware that the specification document that is in this repository is not yet in a state that could be useful to anyone who has not been attending the bi-weekly standards working group (SWG) meetings and/or who is not actively working on the document.  The SWG is working diligently to update the specification so please refer back to this readme periodically for any status updates.
> What we think we have consensus on so far are the following:
> 1. The API will be similar to the [OGC API - Features](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html) API with some extended query capabilities.
> 2. The recommended encoding of a catalogue record will be GeoJSON to take advantage of the available tooling and make STAC alignment easier.
> 3. There will be an endpoint to retrieve the set of queryables (i.e. the properties that may be used to construct a filter).
> 4. The content model of a record will be made up of a set of "core" queryables (i.e. a set of mandatory properties that every record must have; stuff like id, type, title, modified, rights, license, etc.) and then any other properties that a domain of practice (e.g. EO, STAC, etc.) might want to add.

> There have been discussions on a number of other topics too (see the [issues](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/issues) on github) but nothing concrete yet.

# OGC API - Records

## Overview

OGC API - Records provides discovery and access to metadata about geospatial data and services.

[OGC API standards](https://ogcapi.ogc.org) define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. [OpenAPI](http://openapis.org) is used to define the reusable API building blocks.

```
GET /collections/myCatalogue/items
```

Lists all the metadata records in the catalogue.

```
GET /collections/myCatalogue/items?bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89
```

Lists all the metadata records that describe objects in the New Zealand economic zone.

The response format is determined using standard [HTTP content negotiation](https://restfulapi.net/content-negotiation/).

Data is returned in pageable chunks, with each response containing a `next` link pointing to the next set of response records.  The core specification supports a basic set of filters roughly analogous to the [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org) and OGC OpenSearch Geo (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=56866) query parameters.

```
GET /collections/myCatalogue/items/{recordId}
```

Returns a specific metadata record.

## Using the standard

A draft of the OGC API - Records standard is available:

* [Part 1: Core](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-004.html), also available in [PDF](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-004.pdf)

Draft(s) are built daily based on the configuration contained in the [asciidoctor.json](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/blob/master/asciidoctor.json) file.

Those who want to just see the endpoints and responses can explore the generic
OpenAPI definition on SwaggerHub:

* T.B.D.

There have been several implementations of the draft standard, though they are
against different versions of the evolving draft:

## Communication

Join the [mailing list](https://lists.ogc.org/mailman/listinfo/ogcapi-records.swg) or [![chat at https://gitter.im/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records](https://badges.gitter.im/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records.svg)](https://gitter.im/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records)

Most all work on the specification takes place in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/issues), so browse there to get a good idea of what is happening, as well as past decisions.

## Additional Information

* [Checklist for implementers](guide/conformance_checklist.md)

Also a non-normative document, the "OGC API - Records User's Guide", is planned.

The current expectation is to have a stable version of the Core specification in 2020. We want to wait for sufficient implementation feedback, mature implementations including a test suite, results from OGC testbeds and experience with draft extensions first.
